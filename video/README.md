The robot starts from a randomly assigned section determined by a coin toss. The robot must detect the walls or the lines to know when to stop using its sensors or vision system. This challenge tests the teamâ€™s ability to implement reliable line detection , real-time decision making , and precise steering control , all while dealing with varying track widths and randomized obstacle placement in later rounds.
