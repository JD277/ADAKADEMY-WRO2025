# Overview
In this file will be the explanation of the models used for the proyect


## *First prototype (Cooper White)*
- This was the version we design in case the chasis didn´t come in time

## *Fischertechnik kit (The final chasis)*
- althought the chasis we planned initially did come in time

# Mecanical parts

## Direction 
We used the Ackermann steering, also known as Ackermann steering geometry or the Ackermann principle, is a geometric arrangement of the steering linkages in a vehicle that aims to make all wheels follow paths with a common center point during a turn.   
     
Ackermann steering geometry is a design that allows the inner and outer wheels of a vehicle to follow different radius when turning. The inner wheel steers at a greater angle than the outer wheel, ensuring all wheels pivot around a common center point. This minimizes tire scrub and promotes smoother cornering, especially at low speeds.

## Conduction

Powered by the rear axle, which consists of a single-speed transmission, the drive pinion attached to the engine drives the spur gear (1.5 cm in diameter and 38 teeth), which is located on an intermediate shaft to generate greater torque. The force is then transmitted to the metal output shaft (a threaded rod 4 mm in diameter and 15 cm long), which is double and allows both rear wheels to be driven.

When the engine induces a force in the pinion, it moves the crown gear then this movement is passed to the satellite type gear (1.4cm in diameter and 26 teeth), then it goes to the crown gear that moves the other satellite type gear (28 teeth and 1.4cm in diameter) where part of the initial speed is lost, but more force (torque) is gained, this intermediate shaft made of metal is composed of three plastic gears (crown gear, pinion and a normal spur gear), where the pinion and the spur gear drive the output shaft.

After transferring the motion to the output shaft, it transmits the motion to the threaded bar inside the crown gear. The shaft is then sleeved, and the sleeve is attached to the 60BRS ball bearing to stabilize the shaft, which connects to the threaded bar where the wheel will be fitted with a plastic lock. All of these parts are located at the bottom of the vehicle, held in place by a bearing.


# Documentation for models

##  Folder structure
The models files are organized with this order:
```
ADAKADEMY-WRO2025/models/
├── Base de baterias.3mf
├── Base hw-095.3mf
├── Base superior.3mf
├── Clip union.3mf
└── Extension base.3mf
```
Where:

- `/Base de baterias.3mf`: Model used to connect the LX-2BUPS module to the chassis
- `/Base hw-095.3mf`: Model used to connect the HW-095 module to the chassis
- `/Base superior.3mf`: Top extension model to connect more modules to the chassis
- `/Clip union.3mf`: Clip to connect the model extension 
- `/Extension base.3mf`: Extension model to increase the height of components by 10 mm
