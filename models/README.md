# Overview
In this file will be the explanation of the models used for the proyect


## *First prototype (Cooper White)*
- This was the version we design in case the chasis didn´t come in time

├── Wheel_nut.3mf
├── Raspberry4_Base.3mf
└── Base_Extension.3mf
```
Where:

- `/LX-2BUPS_Down_Base.3mf`: Model used to connect the LX-2BUPS module to the chassis
- `/L298N_Base.3mf`: Model used to connect the l298n module to the chassis
- `/Top_Base.3mf`: Top extension model to connect more modules to the chassis
- `/Wheel_nut.3mf`: Nut to adjust the wheels to the axle
- `/Raspberry4_Base.3mf`: Models to connect and protect the Raspberry 4 Model B to the chassis
